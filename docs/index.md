# Documentation

Here, you will learn about how to use all of what thenewboston gem has to offer. If you notice an error or typo, then please create a pull request yourself and we can pull in the changes to save everyone some time.

## Getting Started

There are two ways to use the library.

- You can place `gem "thenewboston"` in your application's `Gemfile` and run `bundle install`
- Or install it yourself by running `gem install thenewboston`

> For simplicity, we will not be including `require` statements in our examples but you can use the library(gem) by using `require "thenewboston"` at the top of your code.
